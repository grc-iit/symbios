How to use:
	Hostfiles folder, two files:
		- hostfile_clients: list of clients to be used, they will get the kernel 
				    module installed.
		- hostfile_servers: list of servers to be used, they will mount the 
				    pvfs-server daemon.
		Feel free to include any other file in this folder, like MPI_hostfiles if you
		need them for benchamrking.
	
	Conf folder, location of the configuration files:
		- Baseline
		- Write Optimize
		- Read Optimize
		The run_experiments.sh script will iterate through all the files present on 
		this folder, theredore, DO NOT add any other file to this folder.
	
	OrangeFs scripts:
		- deploy.sh: starts OrangeFs. Three input arguments:
			- @1: a path to the config file to which to deploy OrangeFS
			- @2: the path to the directory used by the OrangeFS server, it is the data 
			      directory defined on the configuration file
			- @3: the path to the directory where the OrangeFS is going to be mounted in
			      the client nodes and to wich all I/O has to be redirected.
		- terminate.sh: terminates OrangeFS. Takes the exact same three paramters as 
				deploy.
	The pvfs2tab:
		It is a file to indicate to the kernel module and the network location of the
		mount point on the server file. It is necessary, deploy.sh will autogenerated
		at $PVDS2TAB_FILE, more details below, and example is provided and it is 
		still a good idea to point the variable to it, since by default it will
		search at $HOME.
			
	Variables: There are a few variables to set up before running the scripts:
		- ORANGEFS_KO: the location of the kernel module folder. By default in ares 
			       it is:
			/opt/ohpc/pub/orangefs/lib/modules/3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64/kernel/fs/pvfs2
		- ORANGEFS_PATH: the location of the OrangeFS installation directory. By 
				 default in Ares it is: /opt/ohpc/pub/orangefs
		- PVFS2TAB_FILE: the location, or desired location, of the pvfs2tab file. 
				 Default is home but recomended is ./ 
		- PATH: ORANGEFS_PATH has to be added to the path, altough I think it is 
			defaulted for every one in Ares, if you can find "pvfs2-ls" with
		        autocomplete, you are good.
